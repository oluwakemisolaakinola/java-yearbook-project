Project Applications

Portfolio Application

The portfolio application is a web application served using Nginx.

Port:

80

Access:

http://EC2-PUBLIC-IP:80

Java Application

The Java application is packaged using Maven and deployed inside a Docker container.

Port:

8081

Access:

http://EC2-PUBLIC-IP:8081

```

Terraform state files, SSH private keys, environment files, and other sensitive files are excluded using .gitignore.
Terraform Infrastructure

Terraform is used to create the AWS infrastructure required by the application.

AWS resources

Terraform creates:

VPC
Public subnet
Internet Gateway
Route table
Main route table with internet route
Security Group
EC2 instance
Ansible Configuration

Ansible is used to configure the Terraform-created EC2 server.

The Ansible configuration installs and configures:

Docker
Docker Compose
Git
Required server configuration
Docker Deployment

Docker is used to containerize the applications.

Docker Compose manages both application containers
Jenkins CI/CD

Jenkins is running on the WSL/Ubuntu environment.

Jenkins is accessed through:

http://localhost:8080

Jenkins connects to the AWS EC2 deployment server using SSH.

The EC2 SSH private key is stored securely on the Jenkins server and is not committed to GitHub.

9. Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline automates the deployment process.

The pipeline is defined in:

jenkinsfile
The deployment workflow is:

GitHub
   |
   v
Jenkins
   |
   v
SSH to EC2
   |
   v
git pull origin main
   |
   v
docker compose up -d --build
   |
   v
Verify Containers

Jenkins acts as the CI/CD controller while the AWS EC2 server performs the actual application deployment
AWS Security Group

The EC2 Security Group allows the required ports for administration and application access.

Port    Purpose
22      SSH
80      Portfolio Application / HTTP
8080    Jenkins
8081    Java Application

For a production environment, SSH and application ports should be restricted to trusted sources instead of allowing unrestricted internet access
